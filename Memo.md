- we want to host our backend (redis, server, db) on a cloudrun instance, and 
  frontend client on a firebase hosting instance. But we want to have a smooth 
  local development experience as well.

  From a simple search, we can see that self-hosting is generally not the way to
  go when it comes to serverless solutions (i.e. GCP, AWS, etc) so what we can do
  is to just buy a VPS server or host our own server using an old PC or something 
  like a raspberry pi.

- I bought a raspberry pi to create my own server. I've also decided that for this 
  melon project, I could just do everything using managed solutions (i.e. use GCP's 
  fleet of products to realize what I tried to do myself).
